# Voice Clone

This repository is designed to host the models used for various text-to-speech and voice cloning projects. The initial test is going to be using audio from the owl house tv show. Text-to-Speech models are based off code found on the [coqui-ai repository](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS), although I hope to modify some of the models to include speaker, emotion, and potentially gender encodings to improve the level of control over the speech. 

## Audio Strip

This file takes video clips as input and outputs the raw audio for slicing and transcribing.
